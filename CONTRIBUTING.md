# Contributing to the project

## Welcome

Hello, my name is Gabriel, and I'm the author and developer behind DevSpace. Nice to meet you!

I've been working on DevSpace since february 2020, and made a lot of progress so far. The app is getting daily new features and I'm fixing all bugs as soon as I find them. Working privately on something gives you a lot of flexibility, but comes at the cost of being little to not transparent and having trouble getting feedback from users.

I really enjoy working on DevSpace, and I would love to make it become a sustainable business in the next months, but to do so I need to scale it, and that's where I need your help.

## Why become a contributor

Well you don't have to if you don't want to :) By posting feedbacks, bug reports and feature requests you're going to help DevSpace immensely to develop faster and better, my ultime goal is to make people really like, trust and enjoy using it!

## Posting a feedback and asking
If you have any tip or would like to talk with me about something regarding DevSpace, just open an issue and follow these simple guidelines:

#### Name
Start issue name with a [FEEDBACK] or [ASK] tag, followed by a brief description of the topic.

#### Content

#### Name
Start issue name with [BUG] followed by a brief description of the bug

#### Content

## Posting a feature request
